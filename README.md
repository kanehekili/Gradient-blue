# Gradient-blue & Gradient-black
Version 3.25

A GTK theme supporting gtk2 and gtk3

This theme was written for the GTK3.20+ and the GTK 3.18 Version and includes a matching gtk2 Version. It is supposed to be the anti thesis of the flat "material design" and has gradients!

Gradient-blue has been extended with Gradient-black, which is based on the gray theme but more or less completely rewritten...
## How to install
Download the tar.gz file and extract it in your locale .themes folder. Select the the theme with the theme manager of the distro.
Or copy its extracted contents into the /usr/share/themes

Gradient black: ![Download](https://github.com/kanehekili/Gradient-blue/raw/master/GTK-3.22-dark/Gradient-black-325.tar.gz)

Gradient-blue:  ![Download](https://github.com/kanehekili/Gradient-blue/raw/master/GTK-3.22/Gradient-blue-324.2.tar.gz)

For the GTK2 Theme the gtk-engine-murrine (or gtk-murrine-engine) is a prerequiste.

## Hi DPI Versions
The HIDPI Versions are bundled with the "Gradient-blue-324.2" Version and are contained in the tar.gz file and must be installed/unpacked with their "base theme". Reason for this is, that some folders and files are linked to it.
